A paragraph is a series of re
lated sentences developing a central idea, called th
e topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group 
of sentences that supports one central, u
nified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
